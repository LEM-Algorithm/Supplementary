The file **_CIFAR_10.m_** contains the training and corresponding testing code for the neural network. Before running it, we need to replace the train function in the file **_Trainer.m_** with the train function in the file **_train.m_**. The file **_Trainer.m_** is usually located in the toolbox folder that comes with Matlab (the specific location is as follows: toolbox\nnet\cnn\+nnet\+internal\+cnn\Trainer.m).
The files **_data_batch_1.m_**~**_data_batch5.m_** are the training set and the file **_test_batch.m_** is the test set. They are stored on the cloud drive (https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1L4DKvUz-5IO-PoOq6HhBYaEOARL8cLyC?usp=sharing). Please download these 6 files first and directly put them in this folder (**_CIFAR_10_**). 

The file **_net_pretrain.m_** contains a neural network trained using the LEM algorithm (our method) for your reference and testing. This file is also stored on the cloud drive above.
