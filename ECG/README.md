The file **_ECG.m_** contains the training and corresponding testing code for the neural network. Before running it, we need to replace the train function in the file **_Trainer.m_** with the train function in the file **_train.m_**. The file **_Trainer.m_** is usually located in the toolbox folder that comes with Matlab (the specific location is as follows: toolbox\nnet\cnn\+nnet\+internal\+cnn\Trainer.m).
The file **_ECG_Data.m_** contains the training set and the test set. It is stored on the cloud drive (https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1khnd2e0sBh00sla21gpN8mge7HvVNzcn?usp=sharing). Please download it first and directly put it in this folder (**_ECG_**).

The file **_net_pretrain.m_** contains a neural network trained using the LEM algorithm (our method) for your reference and testing. This file is also stored on the cloud drive above.
