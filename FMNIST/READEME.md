The file **_FMNIST.m_** contains the training and corresponding testing code for the neural network. Before running it, we need to replace the train function in the file **_Trainer.m_** with the train function in the file **_train.m_**. The file **_Trainer.m_** is usually located in the toolbox folder that comes with Matlab (the specific location is as follows: toolbox\nnet\cnn\+nnet\+internal\+cnn\Trainer.m). Besides, please comment out the command on line 49 of the file **_DefaultNetworkOptimizer.m_**, whose file path is “toolbox\nnet\cnn\+nnet\+internal\+cnn\+optimizer\DefaultNetworkOptimizer.m”, and the command to be commented out is as follows:  
_% obj.addLayerFuser( nnet.internal.cnn.layer.ConvolutionReLU.LayerFuser )_

The folder **_fashion_mnist_train_** contains the training set while the folder **_fashion_mnist_test_** is the test set. They are stored on the cloud drive (https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Cwjt1c7eSkrlBg3iqPbYKw1TqiFilcPb?usp=sharing). Please download these 2 zip files first and directly unzip them to this folder (**_FMNIST_**). 

The file **_net_pretrain.m_** contains a neural network trained using the LEM algorithm (our method) for your reference and testing. This file is also stored on the cloud drive above.
