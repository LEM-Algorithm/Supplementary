The file **_mini_ImageNet.m_** contains the training and corresponding testing code for the neural network. The file **_Layer_graph.mat_** contains the network to be trained in this task. Before running **_mini_ImageNet.mat_**, we need to replace the train function in the file **_Trainer.m_** with the train function in the file **_train.m_**. The file **_Trainer.m_** is usually located in the toolbox folder that comes with Matlab (the specific location is as follows: toolbox\nnet\cnn\+nnet\+internal\+cnn\Trainer.m).

The files **_train_set.mat_** and **_val_set.m_** are the training set and validation set which are stored on the cloud drive (https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1iQy66pQee1Z2RAUjgDdWpe0Vxefc5bBm?usp=sharing). Please download these 2 files first and directly put them in this folder (**_mini_ImageNet_**). The files **_imagenet_train.csv_** and **_imagenet_val.csv_** show how to partition the original dataset.

The file **_net_pretrain.m_** contains a neural network trained using the LEM algorithm (our method) for your reference and testing. This file is also stored on the cloud drive above.
