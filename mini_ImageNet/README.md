The file mini_ImageNet contains the training and corresponding testing code for the neural network. 
The file Layer_graph contains the network to be trained in this task. Before running mini_ImageNet, we need to replace the train function in the file Trainer with the train function in the file train. 
The file Trainer is usually located in the toolbox folder that comes with Matlab (the specific location is as follows: toolbox\nnet\cnn\+nnet\+internal\+cnn\Trainer.m).
